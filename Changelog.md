## 0.8.2 - 17/03/2025

### Fixed
- GUI cleanup.
- `'QgsPolygon3DSymbol' object has no attribute 'setMaterial'`.
- Issue where empty layer(s) with *[LoD: None]* were unnecessarily created when the option to load LoD "As layers" was selected.

### Removed
- Behavior where a group layer was created even when only a single layer was loaded.

### Added
- **Multi-File Loading**: The plugin now supports processing multiple CityJSON files at once. The GUI has been modified to allow the selection and display of multiple files in a dynamic list. When a file is selected from the list, its metadata is dynamically updated in the metadata field.
- **Control Inheritance of Attributes**: Added a CheckBox to control whether child objects inherit parent attributes.
- **LoD Selection**: Added a ComboBox to select a specific LoD to import (e.g., "All", "1.2", "1.3", "2.2", etc.).
- **New Semantic Surface Attributes**: Support for additional semantic surface attributes when loading a CityJSON file using the option *Load semantic surfaces (as individual features)*. Compatible with CityJSON files generated by [**3DBM-Plus**](https://github.com/FLeroux23/3DBM-Plus), a custom version of [**3d-building-metrics**](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3d-building-metrics).
